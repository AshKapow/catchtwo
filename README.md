## Pokétwo Autocatcher

A truly open-source and free Pokétwo autocatcher, created with the goal of preventing people from wasting their money.

### Requirements
Please note that this autocatcher requires Python 3.8 installed. Python 3.9 won't work.

### Getting Started:
To start up the bot for the first time, please install the required dependencies first:
```
python -m pip install -U discum
```

Channel ID: <br>
  Enable discord developer mode <br />
  Right click the channel where you want to catch pokemon and click copy ID<br />
  Paste the ID in the Channel ID section in the info.txt file located in the data/ folder<br />

User Token: <br />
  Place your discord account's user token (or request header authorization token I guess?) into the info.txt file located in the data/ folder <br />
 
Invite poketwo in your server as well and start the python file.<br/>
<br/>

### ⚠️DISCLAIMER⚠️ <hr />
please note that self botting is not allowed by discord (https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-user-accounts-self-bots-) and that this is just an experimental project for myself</br>
