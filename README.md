### **Pokétwo Autocatcher**
A truly open-source and free Pokétwo autocatcher, created with the goal of preventing people from wasting their money.

---

### Features
The bot has the following features:
- Easy Setup (simply run a script and enter the correct information, no 'programming' required)
- Get notified when and if you've caught a Pokémon, and also if another event occurs
    - See when a Shiny/Legendary/Ultra Beast/Mythical Pokémon is caught, and which one it is!
- **Completely free** and open-source (you can see the code as it is currently)
- Support for all Pokémon from generation I to generation VIII, including Alolan and Galarian Pokémon

### Requirements
Please note that this autocatcher requires Python 3.8 installed. Python 3.9 won't work with Discord.

### Getting Started:
To start up the bot for the first time, please install the required dependencies first:
```
python -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/Merubokkusu/Discord-S.C.U.M.git
```
> Remember to modify the command to your installed one if necessary. <br>
> However, this command should work in most cases.

#### <b>Running the bot</b>
Once you have installed the correct dependencies, run the `setup.py` file and enter in the following fields when asked.

#### <b>user_token</b>:
Paste in your discord account's user token. You can find instructions on this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W9tAEsK7RM) <br>

#### <b>channel_id</b>:
This will allow the bot to use your preferred channel to spam as well as catch Pokétwo spawns. <br>
Make sure you paste this carefully, as If you set it to the wrong channel it will spam and catch there. <br>
See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dqYctHmazc) for help on getting this.

After you've done the above, simply run the following command to start up your very own Pokétwo Autocatcher.
```
py main.py
```
The command may vary depending on your operating system, so try `python3 main.py` if this doesn't work.

> Remember to cd into your autocatcher folder as well. If you need any help with something, feel free to open a Github Issue.

### Setting up on repl.it
To setup the autocatcher via repl.it, go to the repl.it [here](https://replit.com/@devraza/autocatcher).
Once the repl.it page is opened, click 'Fork repl'. <br> Fill in any required information when prompted, and then click the green 'Run' button at the top of the repl; give the info needed by the self bot when prompted, and then you're good to go!

> Please note that creating your self bot on a public repl will mean that anyone who sees the repl can access your account. <br> Private repl's are paid by default, so unless you are willing to pay for a private repl, just host it yourself.

### Disclaimer
Please note that self botting is against Discord's Terms of Service and being discovered <br> 
using a self bot may result in your account being banned. To avoid this, keep knowledge of your self bot <br> to a minimum and set the channel_id field correctly. I am not responsible for any accounts lost due to the self bot. <br> I also recommend checking the self bot channel's messages occasionally to see if Pokétwo has sent a captcha. <br> **If it has, it would be a good idea to solve it.** <br>
