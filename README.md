## Pokétwo Autocatcher

A truly open-source and free Pokétwo autocatcher, created with the goal of preventing people from wasting their money.

### Requirements
Please note that this autocatcher requires Python 3.8 installed. Python 3.9 won't work.

### Getting Started:
To start up the bot for the first time, please install the required dependencies first:
```
python -m pip install -U discum
```

Once you've installed the required dependencies, open your config.json (located in the data folder) <br>
and insert the correct data into the following fields

#### <b>user_token</b>:
Place your discord account's user token here. You can find instructions on this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W9tAEsK7RM) <br>
 
#### <b>channel_id</b>:
This will allow the bot to use your preferred channel to spam as well as catch Pokétwo spawns. <br>
Make sure you set this carefully, as If you set it to the wrong channel it will spam and catch there. <br>
See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dqYctHmazc) for help on this.

#### <b>Running the bot</b>
After you've done the above, simply run the following command to start up your very own Pokétwo Autocatcher.
```
python3 main.py
```
> Remember to cd into your autocatcher folder as well. If you need any help with something, feel free to open an issue

### Disclaimer
please note that self botting is against Discord's Terms of Service and being discovered <br> 
using a self bot may result in your account being banned. To avoid this, keep knowledge of your self bot <br> to a minimum and set the channel_id field correctly <br>
